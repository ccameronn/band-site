              The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
              California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy,
              guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist Kent
              Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first
              commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from
              manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular acts (The
              Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was
              confident the band could succeed even further, pushing them to
              sign with Magenta Records.

            <p>
              From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition
              and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
              immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic
              attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and
              fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately
              refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid
              and authentic performances on stage. Looking forward to touring in
              the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording their second
              studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.

Project Overview
An up-and-coming band has approached you to design a website for them! You've come to an agreement that this project will be delivered in 3 parts. You will be required to build a website with all the required functionality over the next 3 sprints. Each sprint has a required deliverable. Creative mock ups and design specs will be provided, and your task is to use the mock ups and requirements to create a fully functional live site for the band.

For this first sprint, you will be focused on building a responsive website based on the provided mock ups and design specs.

To submit this deliverable, create a new branch called sprint-1 where you will complete your project, then ensure you merge your sprint-1 branch with the main branch. Submit the link to your GitHub repository in Synapse before the submission deadline.

Tools & Resources
Make use of a design package (assets, style guide, and creative mockup) to create a functional and responsive site.

Download the complete design package here.

If you discover any discrepancies between the mockups and the style guide, always remember to match the mockup to the best of your ability.

Be sure to use Sass to compile your project’s CSS. If you don’t have a Sass compiler installed, please see the installation instructions in the Content tab in Synapse.

Functional Requirements
Return Home Link: Located in the top-left corner of the nav is the wordmark / logo "BANDSITE". Clicking on this should return visitors to the bio page.
Visual Design Requirements
The site must closely resemble the mockups and design specs provided in the design package.
The site must be responsive at all dimensions, including between, above & below the provided break-points (between 320px and 1920px your site should be consistent)
The site must be approached using a mobile-first design approach.
Responsive units must be used wherever possible in order to have elements respond to changes in the browser window size. Use px values to calculate responsive units wherever necessary.
You must use the assets provided for the hero image, the musicians image, and the photo gallery.
Implementation Requirements
Your project must follow the proper folder structure and naming conventions outlined in the project guidelines.
You must use Sass for your styling, and take advantage of Sass variables, plus any other Sass features that can help improve your code.
Class naming for your styling must use BEM.
Layout of the site must use Flexbox. Follow component based design and identify common blocks of code which you can reuse your styles for.
Project Structure - Bandsite 1
Remember to use your sprint-1 branch for development during this sprint, and merge your sprint-1 branch with main when submitting your sprint. Project structure - BandSite Sprint 1











Diving Deeper
Diving Deeper challenges should only be attempted if all project requirements are met and adding Diving Deeper challenges does not conflict with the existing requirements. The following are suggestions that you can try, to take your understanding deeper and go above and beyond.

Applying Pseudo-classes
Hover Effects: Often, nav bars or card components incorporate some sort of hover functionality to help users identify where they are on the page, and also to add some polish to the overall feel of the site.

Try adding a hover effect to the navigation of this website in the style of your choosing. See the "Content" tab for a brief overview of pseudo-classes mentioned previously in Synapse.
Photo Gallery Hover: Use pseudo-classes to have the images of the gallery grayscale by default, and when the user hovers over each image it returns to color. This feature must make use of a CSS filter.
Applying Page Functionality
Mailto Link: Located in the footer of the web page is the contact information for several agents. Clicking on the email addresses listed should open up a user's mail account where they can begin to draft a message to the specific contact. See Requirement Level Key Words. -->
